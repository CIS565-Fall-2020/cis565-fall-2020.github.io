## Course Description

A timeline section from the following topics:

* **GPU Computing**: GPU architecture, massively parallel programming, parallel algorithms, performance.
* **Rendering**: Graphics pipeline (rasterization), path tracing, deferred shading, forward+ rendering, VR.
* **APIs**: CUDA, WebGL, RTX, Vulkan.

This is a project-intensive course with significant coding, writing, and presenting. It is **more work** than any other course, but it is worth it.

For a course more focused on GPU architecture without graphics, see Joe Devietti's [CIS 601](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~devietti/classes/cis601-spring2017/){:target="_blank"} (no longer offered at Penn).

## COVID-19 and Plans for Fall 2020 Semester

Please visit the [COVID-19](/covid-19/) page to read more about how CIS 565 will continue to provide the best learning experience possible in Fall 2020 as we switch to remote learning.

If you have registered as a student for the course, or plan to, please complete this **required survey: [CIS 565 Fall 2020 Student Survey](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=DQSIkWdsW0yxEjajBLZtrQAAAAAAAAAAAAMAALDIch9UNFhVQ1hTREZEWUIzVkpDUk83VkNPVU5MRy4u){:target="_blank"}**.

## Academic Integrity

An academic integrity violation will result in the student receiving an F in this course.

See [Academic Integrity at the University of Pennsylvania: A Guide for Students](http://www.upenn.edu/academicintegrity/){:target="_blank"}.

**Code submissions will be cross-checked for plaigarism against previous years' submissions as well as submissions from your colleagues using automated software. <u>Please do not copy code.</u>**

If you would like to use code not written by you for this class, please run it by the TAs using Piazza for permission to use it. Examples of code you will need to ask permission to use:

* Public Github Repositories and other open source projects.
* Projects from other classes that will give you a non-trivial advantage for the project.

If you think you need to ask permission, you should ask. We will most likely approve all reasonable requests.
