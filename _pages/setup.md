## Hardware and Software Requirements

CIS 565 requires access to an NVIDIA GPU to complete the projects. Most projects can run on any modern NVIDIA GPU. The course also has a DirectX RayTracing project that requires a GPU capable of RayTracing. These pages provide instructions for step your computer correctly for class projects.

### Requirements

* **CPU**: Any modern CPU
* **Operating System**:
  * Windows 10 (1809 or newer) or Windows Server 2019 (1809 or newer) - **Required** for DirectX RayTracing Project and **recommended** for the coursework.
  * Linux (any modern distribution) - Supports all projects except DirectX RayTracing project.
* **GPU**: An NVIDIA GPU Required for the course.
  * Any modern NVIDIA GPU supports all projects except DirectX RayTracing.
  * DirectX RayTracing project requires either:
    * A RayTracing GPU (GeForce/Quadro RTX, Tesla T4, or other Turing GPUs) - Recommended.
    * A GPU that supports software fallback (eg. Maxwell or newer architecture. We'll test this as part of [Project 0](https://github.com/CIS565-Fall-2020/Project0-Getting-Started)) - Works, but not recommended.
